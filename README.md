# Project Refactoring with TypeScript and TypeORM

This project is a refactor of the previous project, incorporating modern technologies such as TypeScript and the TypeORM (Object-Relational Mapping) ORM. These additions enhance efficiency, scalability, and maintainability of the project.

### Key Features
Utilizes TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and modern ECMAScript features. It helps catch errors early and facilitates code maintenance as the project grows.

TypeORM ORM: TypeORM is a powerful ORM compatible with multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. It provides a simple, object-oriented interface for interacting with the database, simplifying queries and CRUD operations.
